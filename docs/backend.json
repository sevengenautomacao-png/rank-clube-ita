    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to securely manage Pathfinder units and their members, prioritizing authorization independence and clear security rules.  The core structure revolves around a user-centric approach for managing units, leveraging path-based ownership.  The structure is optimized for `list` operations and avoids rule-based filtering (QAPs). Authorization Independence is achieved by avoiding any `get()` requests in the rules. Specifically, access to `/units/{unitId}/members/{memberId}` is governed by the `unitId` path parameter, meaning a user with access to the `/units/{unitId}` can `list` the members without needing to know anything about the members themselves.\n\nThe structure also separates unit-specific data into its own subcollection under each unit to achieve data isolation and efficient querying. The use of consistent naming conventions (e.g., `unitId`) ensures predictability and simplifies rule creation.\n\nThe use of path-based ownership (`/units/{unitId}/members/{memberId}`) ensures that list operations are secure without overly complex rules. The structure avoids placing data requiring different access control into the same collection, further simplifying security rule design."
